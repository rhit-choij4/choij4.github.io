            My name is Jinyoung Choi. Im a sophmore in Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
            Im a Cs Major. I like games and currently i am playing Genshin Impact, Epic Seven, and World Flipper
            I want to start playing the witche series but I just dont have time. I love anime as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goals for the future is to make games and maybe one day make a game with my friends
            or by myself. So i really should start with something but man. The school work is killing me XD. 
            I do have a few story in mind I do want to implement. Most of these games will probably be story based. 
            I also should study more C# because many game developing IDE use C#. Only if i had time sigh.
